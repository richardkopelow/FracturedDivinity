![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121322/19498019/d8827370-9543-11e6-82d8-6da822b6147b.png)

## The Challenge
You have the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

## The Game
Fractured Divinity is a game about collecting the pieces of a fallen God. Use these fragments to sneak through secure buildings, see things that no human would be able to, or charge through a fire fight without even a scratch. These fragments are dangerous, not just in the wrong hands, but in any hands. The mortal body was not made to hold so much power, and a power that is saving your life might be the thing that ends it. Over time, the fragments augment their wielder, changing them into something able to contain that power.
